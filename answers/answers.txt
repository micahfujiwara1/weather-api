1. I chose to use SQLite for my database and SQLAlchemy ORM for my modeling. Models.py provides the schema for the data model.

2. ingest_data.py contains the code to ingest and push data to my database.

3. ingest_data.py contains methods that performs data cleansing and analysis as well as pushes the transformed data to my database

4. To utilize the API, navigate to 'http://localhost:5000/apidocs' to see API documentation. 
   For unit tests, run 'python3 -m unittest test_file.py' in the terminal

Here are the AWS tools I would utilize:
- AWS API Gateway to deploy my REST API to expose backend HTTP endpoints
- AWS Lambda to host my code serverlessly
- AWS Aurora to host my database
- AWS S3 to house wx_files and yld_files
- AWS CloudWatch to monitor and manage the health of the app through logs/alarms
- AWS EventBridge for scheduling
